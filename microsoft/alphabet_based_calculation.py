"""
Imagine an alphabet of words. Example:
a ==> 1
b ==> 2
c ==> 3
.
z ==> 26
ab ==> 27
ac ==> 28
.
az ==> 51
bc ==> 52
and so on.

Such that the sequence of characters need to be in ascending order only (ab is valid but ba is not). Given any word print its index if valid and 0 if not.

Input	Output
ab	27
ba	0
aez	441

Note: Brute-force is not allowed.
