"""
 Given an array of numbers arr and a number S, find 4 different numbers in arr that sum up to S.

    Write a function that gets arr and S and returns an array with 4 indices of such numbers in arr,
     or null if no such combination exists.
    Explain and code the most efficient solution possible, and analyze its runtime and space complexity.
