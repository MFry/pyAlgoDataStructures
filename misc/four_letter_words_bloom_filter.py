Code up a simple Bloom Filter for four letter words.
 Assume all words are lowercase, exactly four letters long, and only use the letters a to z.
 An example set of test words might be
  able, band, bend, card, darn, form, grab, harm, look, make, mate, peer, and team,
  but assume the actual list of words is much bigger.
